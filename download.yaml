# monitorperf.sh will be executed  as
# to create CSV file from upload process log and upload the log (to processlog BUCKET) and  csv (to csv BUCKET) run: 
# ./monitorperf.sh -f upload.yaml  
# to create CSV file from download process log and upload the log (to processlog BUCKET) and  csv (to csv BUCKET) run:
